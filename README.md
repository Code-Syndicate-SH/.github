# 🌱 Smart Roots 🌱

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Smart Roots is a cool **IoT-powered hydroponic system** built to help grow fruits, veggies, and animal fodder — all in controlled grow tents. Right now, we have two tents running:  
- 🍅 One for fruits & vegetables  
- 🌾 One for animal fodder  

But that’s not all — we’re working on expanding into a **tunnel system** soon to grow even more!

## 🌟 Why Smart Roots?  
Farmers often struggle to manually monitor their crops and fodder, especially dealing with pesky **pests 🐛** that harm growth. Our system helps by:  
- Automating plant growth 🌿  
- Using **AI 🤖** to detect and manage pests automatically  
- Giving farmers a smart, hands-free solution to boost productivity  

Plus, as students, this project is a chance to dive into lots of tech — from software dev to AI to hardware and IoT — and level up our skills! 💻⚙️

## 🎯 Key Features  
- 📡 Real-time monitoring: temperature, humidity, light, nutrients  
- 🤖 AI-powered pest detection & automated management  
- 💧 Automated irrigation, lighting & ventilation control  
- 🥕 Separate setups for fruits/veggies & fodder  
- 📊 Data logging & growth optimization  
- 🚧 Modular design for future tunnel system expansion
